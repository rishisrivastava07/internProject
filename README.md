# Asset Management API

## MongoDB Schema Design

### Assets Collection:

- **Asset ID:** (String) Unique identifier for the asset.
- **Asset Name:** (String) Name of the asset.
- **Asset Type:** (String) Type or category of the asset.
- **Location:** (String) Physical location of the asset.
- **Purchase Date:** (Date) Date when the asset was purchased.
- **Initial Cost:** (Number) Initial cost of acquiring the asset.
- **Operational Status:** (String) Current operational status of the asset.

### PerformanceMetrics Collection:

- **Asset ID:** (String) Unique identifier linking to the corresponding asset.
- **Uptime:** (Number) Percentage of time the asset is operational.
- **Downtime:** (Number) Percentage of time the asset is non-operational.
- **Maintenance Costs:** (Number) Cost associated with maintaining the asset.
- **Failure Rate:** (Number) Rate at which the asset experiences failures.
- **Efficiency:** (Number) Efficiency metrics specific to the asset.

## API Functionality

- **CRUD Operations:**
  - Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for both Assets and PerformanceMetrics.

- **Endpoints for Aggregating Data:**
  - Calculate average downtime.
  - Calculate total maintenance costs.
  - Identify assets with high failure rates.

- **Authentication:**
  - Implement simple authentication (e.g., API key, token) to secure sensitive endpoints.

## Data Aggregation and Insights

- **Average Downtime:**
  - Endpoint to calculate and return the average downtime across all assets.

- **Total Maintenance Costs:**
  - Endpoint to calculate and return the total maintenance costs across all assets.

- **High Failure Rates:**
  - Endpoint to identify and return assets with high failure rates.

## Development Considerations

- **Clean and Efficient Code:**
  - Follow best practices for code organization, readability, and performance.

- **Thorough Documentation:**
  - Provide comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and details of each API endpoint.

- **Testing:**
  - Include unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality of CRUD operations and endpoint logic.

- **Scalability:**
  - Design the system with scalability in mind, considering potential future growth in data volume.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement robust error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages.

- **Security:**
  - Regularly update dependencies, use secure practices, and validate user inputs to enhance security.

## Getting Started

To set up the API locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up a MongoDB database and update the connection string in the configuration.
4. Run the API using `npm start`.
5. Access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

For detailed API documentation, refer to the [API Documentation](docs/api.md) file.

## API Documentation

Check the [API Documentation](docs/api.md) for detailed information on API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication.
